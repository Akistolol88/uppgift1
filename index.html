        <p>I got interested in Speedrunning in 2013 when I was browsing twitch for one of my childhood games Super Mario World and found a Japanese Speedrunner. I started learning the game myself and in 2016 I held the WR in the category 96 Exits(100%) for almost a whole year. in 2016 I also participated in the speedrunning charity Marathon event Awesome Games Done Quick. At that time it was held in Washington DC. In 2018 I participated in the Japanese speedrunning marathon event RTA in Japan in Tokyo. </p>

        <h2>Pokemon GO</h2>
        <p>I started playing Pokemon GO thanks to a friend about a week after it was released in Sweden.It was a great way for me to go outside and it is still to this day. I was the 6th person in Sweden to reach level 40 and among the top 200 to reach 40 in the world. Thanks to this game I have travelled a lot and made friends all over the world.</p>

        <p>I began working at ICA Södercentrum in November 2012. We are a great team and a lot of the staff has been working there for over 20+ years. Since 2022 we have a new owner. Carl is the son of the previous owner Per Albertsson. We have increased our sales by a huge margin the past 3 years. In 2023 we began having cheap discounts where you book on facebook or instagram which resulted in a huge increase in customers and sales.
